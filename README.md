/**
 * This project demonstrates the new features in Java 17 compared to Java 11.
 * These features include:
 * 
 * - Records, which reduce boilerplate code and make code more concise and easier to read
 * - Enhanced pattern matching for instanceof, which simplifies code and eliminates the need for redundant type checks and casting
 * - Sealed classes, which provide more control over class hierarchies and can help prevent bugs caused by unintended subclasses
 * - Switch expressions, which make code more concise and easier to read compared to traditional switch statements
 * - Text blocks, which make it easier to write and read multi-line strings
 * - Improved performance for ZGC and Shenandoah garbage collectors, which can help improve application performance
 * - New APIs for working with files and streams, which make it easier to write high-performance and scalable applications
 *
 * By using these new features in Java 17, developers can write more concise, expressive, and performant code.
